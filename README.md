# BLW Bites

**BLW Bites** is a production-ready iOS app that helps parents introduce solid foods to their babies using the Baby Led Weaning (BLW) method.  
The app provides a curated food database, safe preparation guidelines, family-friendly recipes, and subscription-based access to premium content.

## 👨‍💻 My Role

I was fully responsible for the end-to-end creation of the app — from concept, design, and architecture, to development, backend integration, testing, and release.

My responsibilities included:

- **Complete UI/UX design** of the entire application  
  (screen layouts, navigation flow, visual identity, colors, icons, component styling, and user interactions)

- **Application architecture** using UIKit with  
  **MVC + MVVM applied on complex screens** for better scalability and maintainability

- **Full iOS development**  
  (view controllers, custom components, data handling, animations, navigation)

- **Local and remote data modeling**, including a scalable structure for foods, recipes, age segments, and meal plans

- **Firebase integration**  
  (Auth, Firestore, Storage, Crashlytics, App Check, conditional Analytics via ATT)

- **RevenueCat integration**  
  (subscription paywall, entitlements, restore flow)

- **Custom UI features**, such as full-screen image viewer with zoom/pinch and smooth Vimeo video playback

- **Internationalization & localization** across multiple languages

- **Build setup**, dependency management (CocoaPods), and release preparation

Additionally, I **coordinated and mentored a junior Android developer** tasked with recreating the app for Android.  
I provided architectural guidance, design specifications, code reviews, and ensured **full feature parity and UI/UX consistency** across platforms.
