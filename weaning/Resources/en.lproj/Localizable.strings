This guided me even more toward children’s nutrition.\nI specialized both in theory and practice while expanding the diet of my daughter Lucy, and I continue to expand my knowledge by regularly attending courses and trainings.\n\nIn 2021, I completed a 60-hour course in introducing solids using the Baby Led Weaning method, and in 2022, I obtained the title of Expert in Child Nutrition.\n\nI love educating parents on how to become the first dietitians of their children, because the entire nutritional education process starts within the family.\n\nThis is exactly why this app was created — to help you parents stay focused on what truly matters when you begin introducing solids: EATING TOGETHER at the table. What you eat is what your baby will try too, adjusted in texture and firmness to your child’s developmental abilities.\n\nMany of you may think you need to start with special baby foods or specific baby meals, but my intention with this app is to show you that you should first think about what YOU are going to eat, and then adapt it for your child.\n\nAt first, it may be hard to believe that this is all possible, but I hope that as I accompany you on this journey, you will discover that feeding little ones is actually a wonderful adventure of exploring real food together.\n\nOn this journey, I’ll show you how to feed your child — and your whole family — in the best possible way: once you learn to eat together with your child, you will never want to go back.\n\nIf you have any questions or want to share your thoughts about the app, you can email me at <a href=\"mailto:blwbites@gmail.com\">blwbites@gmail.com</a>.";

"MENU_30_DAYS_EXPLICATORY_TEXT" = "According to current infant feeding guidelines, <b>there is no fixed order for introducing solid foods</b>. There are also no recommendations on how much a baby should eat or what texture meals should have.\n\n\n<b>The parent decides what, when, and in what form to offer food. The baby decides whether and how much to eat.</b>\n\n\nHowever, remember not to offer whole, complex, multi-ingredient recipes from the very first day of introducing solids.\n\n\n<b>How to use this meal plan?</b>\n\n• This plan starts on Day 1 because foods are introduced and combined gradually — it is an EXAMPLE meal plan.\n• In the first days of introducing solids, introduce each product gradually, starting with a few small pieces.\n\n• At the very beginning, introduce only 1 new food per day due to the possibility of an allergic reaction. After confirming there is no reaction, you can start combining foods and preparing full meals. That’s why during the first days we start with offering individual vegetables or pairs of vegetables.\n\n• <b>In the case of potentially allergenic foods (marked with an asterisk (*)), they should be introduced for 3 consecutive days.</b> If no allergy develops after that period, they can be combined. <b>If your baby shows any allergic symptoms after a meal, note exactly what they ate and consult a pediatrician</b>, who will guide you in continuing solids.\n\n• Introduce new foods early in the day (before 5 PM), as it's difficult to monitor allergic reactions in the evening when the child is sleeping.\n\n• For the first 30 days I suggest offering 1 meal per day (definitely in the first week). BUT nothing prevents you, in the following weeks, from offering 2 meals per day — for example breakfast and lunch, plus snacks if desired. <b>It all depends on your daily routine and your baby’s interest in food</b>.\n\n<b>In the fourth week of introducing solids, if you have not observed any allergic reactions, you can freely combine foods and even introduce several new items within one meal.</b>\n\n• Remember that until 1 year of age, the main source of nutrients is breast milk or formula — milk should be offered first, followed 30–60 minutes later by solids. Complementary feeding never replaces milk nor is it a dessert (unless your baby wants to eat both before and after). It is your baby’s main meal.\n\n• The portion size in the photos is completely random and is ONLY meant to show HOW to serve the meal, not how much the baby should eat.\n\n\n<b>How much should a baby eat?</b>\n\n• In the first month, the baby does not need to “fill up” on solids — they only need to learn new tastes, smells, and textures. They may eat a few spoonfuls, or they may not want to try anything at all. <b>Remember, your baby decides whether and how much to eat.</b> And remember, breast milk or formula provides all needed nutrients.\n\n• This meal plan is an example. If your family doesn’t eat certain foods, you can replace them.\n\n• In the plan I propose introducing 1 new food during each meal. In the first week, this is 1 new food per day. In later weeks, you combine already-introduced foods and add new ones. If you feel this is too many new items at once, you can extend the plan over 2 months and introduce new foods every 2 days.\n\n• <b>Always trust your baby’s hunger and fullness cues.</b> Start with small portions and offer more if the baby wants it. If the baby seems full or wants to leave the high chair, do not force more food.\n\n• Choose the ideal time for offering meals — when the baby is not sleepy, hungry, or tired. And never at night (so it’s easier to identify allergic reactions).\n\n\nBy clicking on each food you will find more information on safe serving (cutting and cooking) and recipes.";

There are also no recommendations on how much a baby should eat or what texture meals should have.\n\n\n<b>The parent decides what, when, and in what form to offer food. The baby decides whether and how much to eat.</b>\n\n\nThis meal plan was created with the entire family in mind. It is balanced in nutrients and has appropriate energy density. Each main meal (breakfast, lunch, dinner) includes a portion of carbohydrates, protein, vegetables and healthy fats in line with the HEALTHY EATING PLATE adapted for children.\n\n\nThat means:\n⅓ of the plate = VEGETABLES\n\n¼ of the plate = CARBOHYDRATES such as grains and starchy foods: pasta, groats, potatoes, rice, bread\n\n¼ of the plate = PROTEIN such as meat, fish, legumes, eggs, dairy products\n\n\nEach recipe can be eaten together as a family and offers many benefits:\n\n-> Children observe and imitate parents at the table, learning a positive relationship with food. <b>They see that what’s on the adult plate is good, because adults eat it with appetite.</b> Shared meals in a pleasant atmosphere help them try new flavors without pressure.\n\n-> The child learns that the table is the place to eat — not the couch or in front of the TV.\n\n-> <b>Shared meals save cooking time because everyone eats the same food.</b>\n\n-> If your family has been eating a limited variety of foods, now is the perfect time to change that.\n\n-> <b>No added salt or sugar</b> is included in the recipes. You may use herbs and spices. Adult portions can be salted later, directly on the plate.\n\n\n<b>How to use this meal plan?</b>\n\n• <b>All recipes are seasonal and based on local ingredients.</b> The plan updates every month to include seasonal fruits and vegetables.\n\n• <b>Potentially allergenic foods (marked with an asterisk (*)) should be introduced for 3 consecutive days.</b> If no allergy develops, they can be combined. <b>If your baby shows any allergic symptoms, note exactly what they ate and consult a pediatrician</b> who will guide you further.\n\n• Introduce new foods early in the day (before 5 PM) because it’s difficult to monitor allergic reactions in the evening.\n\n• The portion sizes shown in the photos are random — they only illustrate HOW to serve the meal, not how much should be eaten.\n\n• You’ll find many recipes divided into simple breakfasts, lunches, dinners and snacks. But nothing stops you from serving breakfast at dinner or dinner at lunch.\n\n• <b>You don’t need to follow the recipes step-by-step.</b> You can simply use them as inspiration and adapt them for your family.\n\n\n<b>How many foods per day should you offer?</b>\n\n-> Around 7 months: breakfast + lunch\n\n-> 8 months: breakfast, lunch, afternoon snack\n\n-> 9 months: breakfast, lunch, afternoon snack, dinner\n\n-> 10 months: breakfast, lunch, afternoon snack, dinner\n\n-> 11 months: breakfast, lunch, afternoon snack, dinner\n\n-> 12+ months: breakfast, second breakfast, lunch, afternoon snack, dinner\n\n\n<b>REMEMBER: the BABY decides what, how much, and whether to eat at all.</b>";
